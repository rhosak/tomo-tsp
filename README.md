Optimizing the order of polarization projections for n-qubit state tomography.

This repository provides supplementary material to the following paper by Radim Hošák, Robert Stárek, and Miroslav Ježek:
**The optimal strategy for photonic quantum tomography** ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07521): arXiv 1809.07521 [quant-ph])

## Polarization tomography and the traveling salesman problem TSP
See [TOMO_TSP.md](TOMO_TSP.md) for the basic information on polarization tomography and its specification as TSP.

## Software prerequisities

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* Python 3 modules:
   * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
   * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (optional, for plotting)
* [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/downloads.htm) TSP solver

## The workflow
See [the wave_plate_tsp.ipynb Jupyter notebook](wave_plate_tsp.ipynb) for a detailed guide on how to formulate and solve the TSP. The notebook solves the tomography TSP for polarization-encoded photonic qubits, asuuming one single-photon detector per qubit (the _six-state scheme_).

## TSP solutions
The TSP solutions for n-qubit (n up to five) polarization tomography, generated by Concorde, are stored in the files `nq_6s.sol`, with `n` being a number from 1 to 5. The files contain a list of indices that dictate the TSP-optimized order of the polarization projections. For the one-qubit case, the projections `H`, `V`, `D`, `A`, `R`, `L` correspond to indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively. For higher-qubit cases, the order of the indices follows this logic: `HHH`, `HHV`, ..., `HHL`, `HVH`, `HVV`, ..., `HVL`, ..., `HLL`, `VHH`, `VHV`, ..., `VHL`, ..., `LLL`.
